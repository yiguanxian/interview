task:
	Given an array(list) of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
	You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
	Example:
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].
algorithmï¼š
	creat a dictionary which key is value of list and value is index of list
	choose any a value of list and then judge whether the difference between target and value chosed in list
	list of python has method index() which can find index according to the value.
time complexity:
	O(n)
